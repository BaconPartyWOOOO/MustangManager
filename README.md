# Mustang Manager
Cal Poly student schedule planning RESTful app developed in Software Engineering I and II at Cal Poly SLO. Mustang Manager is built with Maven with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku with a Java backend developed through the Spring framework. Code quality monitored by sonarqube. Continuous deployment through Heroku. Frontend developed with AngularJS. This project was originally developed in a group of 5 but the original repository is no longer available so I have made the relevant parts of the project public for the sake of portfolio completeness.
